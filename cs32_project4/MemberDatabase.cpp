/*
 This method loads the member database from the data file specified by the filename parameter,
 e.g., members.txt. The method must load the data into data structures that enable efficient
 retrieval of email addresses (meeting the big-O requirements at the top of this section). The
 method must return true if the file was successfully loaded and false otherwise. If two members
 in the data file have the same email address, this method returns false.
 
 You may assume that there are no extraneous spaces at the beginning or ending of any line, or
 before or after any commas. The file may contain uppercase and lowercase letters. You may
 assume that thereâ€™s a single empty line separating each member in the file. You can look at our
 synthetically-generated members.txt file for an example of what you will have to parse
